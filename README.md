# Embedded Experiments

This repository contains a collection of experimental and practice projects focused on embedded systems and microcontrollers. The goal of these projects is to build hands-on experience with hardware-software integration using the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W
- IR sensors
- LEDs
- Push buttons
- Breadboard and basic electronic components

## Software & Tools
- MicroPython
- Thonny IDE
- GPIO programming
- Basic digital I/O concepts

## Project Structure
Each folder contains a small, self-contained experiment:
- Source code
- Brief description of the objective
- Notes on what was learned
