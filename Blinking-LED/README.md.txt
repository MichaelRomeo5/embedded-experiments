## Blinking LED

**Objective:**  
Blink an LED at a fixed interval using MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

**Hardware Used:**
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- LED
- 220Ω resistor

**Software:**
- MicroPython

**Concepts Covered:**
- GPIO output configuration
- Pin state toggling
- Timing delays

**Description:**
The LED connected to GPIO pin 22 toggles its state every 250 ms using a blocking delay loop.

**What I Learned:**
- How to configure GPIO pins as outputs
- How to control timing using sleep()
- How to create a simple infinite control loop
